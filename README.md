## Development Plans

### Client Information

Timbucktoo BMX Club is a not-for-profit BMX sporting club run by a very active group of volunteers.  
They have recently discussed the need for a website where they will be able to direct their members 
to complete their requests for a desired coaching class that is run by a few club coaches.  They are 
a small club of approximately 350 members and attract about 60 new members each year.  

While these members can participate in open practice sessions and racing on a weekly basis, many would 
like some additional coaching classes to hone their skills on the track.  The coaching classes include 
different levels of coaching and different focuses from basic skills, to body readiness, on track skills 
and gate start training.  There are also varying levels of ability in these classes from beginners 
through to advanced.  The members participating in classes may be children or the parents of the children 
who also ride.

Currently the club has limited ways to track how many are attending classes and who is attending classes
as there can be issues with the coach to rider ratios or the riderâ€™s licenses being up to date.  This can
cause issues with insurance and other track incidents.  Members currently have to download the coaching
guidelines and contact the coaches individually for specific information.

### Web Site Goals

The main goal of the site is to enable members to view the different classes, the availability of the 
classes and then be able to view information about the coaches that run them.  Members will be able to 
book and pay for classes in advance. 

The site will display information about club coaches and details about what classes cover and the skills
that are taught in each of these classes.  For the members who run the club they will be able to see how
many are attending classes and who is attending classes.  If a specific class or time is more in demand 
then they will be able to modify their classes or put more coaches on to suit the demand.
